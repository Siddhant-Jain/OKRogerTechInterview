Important information about script:

-The script used to execute phase 1 and phase 2 is written in python. The version
of python is python 3.0 and up. There is no guarantee that this script will work
on lower versions.

-One of the packages that must be installed before running the script is the the
python regex package. In order to do this, you can go into the terminal window and
type "pip install re"

-Before executing the script, make sure to create an text file named input.txt and
store it in the same directory as the python script file

Important information about output and Phases:

-What is important to note is that phase 1 and 2 are both written on the
same python file. The results from phase 1 will show up in an outputPhase1.txt
file which will be in the same directory as the python script file. Likewise
the results of phase 2 will show up in a ouputPhase2.txt file which will also
be in the same directory as the python script file
